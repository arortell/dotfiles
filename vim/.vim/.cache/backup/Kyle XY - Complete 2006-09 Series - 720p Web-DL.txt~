Description:

Plot Synopsis:

"A teenage boy is found wandering, naked and dazed, in traffic. At a nearby youth detention center, authorities discover that this kid -- Kyle -- is a savant who's missing instinctive human behavior like joy, anger and love. Stranger still, he's missing the one thing every mammal has: a belly button. One of the center's psychologists, Natalie Trager, realizes that Kyle needs special attention -- so she brings him home to live with her family. Soon, Kyle starts to investigate his origins ... and some people aren't too happy about it."

P.S: Even though there are NO "Alternate Pilot" or "FUTURE Revealed" episodes (with the INTENDED ending) for the "Web-DL" version of this series, I went ahead and FOUND them FOR you all (and added them in the Season "1" and "3" folders, respectively)! They are in "360p" resolution though considering there are NO "720p-1080p WEB-DL" releases (that I know of) for those two videos, unfortunately...
